        <h1>My short biography</h1>
        <h2>Childhood and early years</h2>
        <p>
            My childhood was in a very interesting time. I was born in the city of Krivoy Rog, in an average family.
            Mobile phones and computers were not yet so widespread and were just beginning to become fashionable.
            That’s why we played ball games on the street, hide-and-seek, went to the river, and in general we couldn’t
            drive them home. At 12 years old I
            I wanted to get my income and I found a part-time job as a loader. Worked before and after school.
        </p>
        <h2>School and student years</h2>
        <p>
            School years passed in parallel with work at the food market. Before and after studying. This gave
            I had the opportunity to buy myself branded items that corresponded to my new interests and hobbies. I began
            make hip-hop music. We had a group and we wrote songs for our own pleasure. Digital
            There weren’t really platforms yet, social networks were just starting to appear, but we made music for
            ourselves without any
            or goals, this is how my school and student years passed at the Metallurgical Academy.
        </p>
        <h2>Adulthood, marriage and divorce</h2>
        <p>
            After receiving my diploma, I quickly got married, quit my job in the market and got a job at a factory.
            Entered the second higher education. There was an idyll in the family and especially, so there was no, there
            was some kind of understanding between
            friend friend. Having graduated from the second institute, thanks to success and pleasure from work, which I
            did not see and did not
            received. I decided to leave the factory and try to do something else, maybe music, maybe.
            THIS. At that moment I didn’t quite understand what I would do in the future, but I knew for sure that this
            was not a factory.
            It was the fifth year of our relationship and against this background a disagreement began, after which it
            was decided
            decision to get a divorce.
        </p>
        <h2>Find myrself, the present moment</h2>
        <p>
            Against the backdrop of all these events, I withdrew into myself to rethink and search for what would bring
            me pleasure while working. So, after a couple of years, looking through different options and areas of work,
            I find myself thinking in IT. Music has remained a spiritual balm and hobby, and I am beginning to study
            this area from the inside and delve into the subtleties and nuances of this work and what professions and
            types of activities there are in general. So after a while I received an offer to become a tester. I passed
            the interview and started working and delving into all the intricacies, signed up for testing courses and
            got into IT Step. Now I understand that for the first time my activity truly brings me pleasure, this is
            where I feel comfortable. At the moment I
            I’m going through the final stages of automation and making a list of new knowledge and skills that have
            clearly increased
            my skill level.
